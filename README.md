# Hello!

Welcome to this glorious contacts organizer. It let's you save contacts with name, email(s) and number(s) and view the full edit history for these contacts. The project is written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, with the assistance of webpack. The aim of the project was to implement a somewhat declarative approach to rendering and routing, and in that regard it can be considered successful.

## How to

Go get the project up and running in development mode, type the following commands:

*  `npm i`
*  `npm start`

If npm start doesn't work for you, do it the manual way with:

*  `node index`
*  `npx webpack`
